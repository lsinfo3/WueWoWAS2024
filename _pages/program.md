# Preliminary Program

The program will include regular presentation sessions with ample time for questions and discussion. For the first time this year, we are organizing a speedmentoring session with invited experts from academia and industry. Participants will have the opportunity to book slots with each of the invited experts to discuss their own work, recent developments, or other professional matters. The workshop will start on Monday morning and finish Tuesday afternoon.
