# Speedmentoring

For the first time this year, we will organize a speedmentoring session. The goal is to provide a platform to get in contact with experts from industry and academia and discuss ongoing research, current developments or other professional issues.

The speedmentoring session will take place on Monday, 30.09.2024 and require explicit registration.

Details on the mode of the session as well as short CVs of the invited mentors will be provided at a later date.
