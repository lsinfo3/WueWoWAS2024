# Speedmentoring

For the first time this year, we will have a speedmentoring session to give participants the chance to get in contact with experts from industry and academia, discuss ongoing research, current developments or other professional mattern.

The speedmentoring session will take place on Monday, 30.09.2024 and require explicit registration. The registration will be handled via edas during the registration for the workshop.

Note that available mentoring slots are limited and exclusive to participating PhD students. We will try our best to assign the slots equally among the registered students.

                <p>Wolfgang is full professor and head of the Chair of Communication Networks in the Department of Computer Engineering of the School of Computation, Information and Technology at Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany. He is internationally recognized for his fundamental research on adaptive, programmable communication networks. His focus is on flexible and adaptive resource management and control of communication systems to support heterogeneous requirements including ultra-low latencies, tactile control and resilience towards 6G. Research methods include measurements, optimization, cross-layer-design, performance evaluation and AI for networking. Before he joined TUM, Wolfgang Kellerer pursued an industrial career being more than ten years with NTT DOCOMO's European research institute in Munich, Germany. His last position was head of the research department for wireless communication and networking, contributing to research and standardization of LTE-A and 5G technologies. In 2001, he was a visiting researcher at the Information Systems Laboratory of Stanford University, California, US. He received his Dr.-Ing. degree (Ph.D.) and his Dipl.-Ing. degree (MSc.) from TUM, in 1995 and 2002, respectively. He has published more than 300 papers in respective journals, conferences and workshops and is inventor of more than 40 patents and patent applications in this area. In 2015, he was awarded with the prestigious ERC Consolidator Grant from the European Commission for his research on network flexibility. He was a co-recipient of the ACM SIGCOMM Best of CCR 2019 award. In 2020, he received the IEEE ComSoc Selected Publication award. He currently serves as an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management and as an area editor for IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials. He is a member of ACM, VDE ITG and a Senior Member of IEEE.</p>
